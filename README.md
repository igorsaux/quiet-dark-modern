## Installation

I haven't had the time to package/upload this to the extension marketplace, but you can still install from source. 
You should not normally do this for extensions you don't trust, but to sideload a `vsix`:

1. Download the file. You can get this theme's packaged file at the latest release, accessible [here](https://github.com/zabackary/quiet-dark-modern/releases/latest).
2. Follow the [instructions to install from a VSIX](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_install-from-a-vsix)
  1. Use the *Extensions: Install from VSIX* command in the Command Palette
  2. Use the UI to select the file you downloaded in step 1
  3. Activate the theme via the theme details page (Extensions sidebar > *Quiet Dark Modern* > Set Color Theme)

<!--
1. Open the **Extensions** sidebar in VS Code. `View â†’ Extensions`
2. Search for `Quiet Dark Modern` and choose "Quiet Dark Modern"
3. Click **Install** to install it
4. Navigate to File > Preferences > Color Theme > **Quiet Dark Modern** (or any of the variants listed)
-->
